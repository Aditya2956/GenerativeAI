# Summary

Tokenization converts the input text into tokens and their corresponding numerical IDs which are decoded back.
Pipelines show usage of Distilbert through Pipelines which eliminates need of boilerplate code to handle NLP algorithms.
Embeddings constructs a vector space of the input texts; a plot shows how the model sees the difference between two inputs.
Conditional, Casual and Masked language models show their specific usage.
